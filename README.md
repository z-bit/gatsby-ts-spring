## Animation with *react-spring*  
*for Gatsby TypeScript Projects*

#### What happened so far:
* First I tried out an animation within an extra page in the **master-gatsby** project.
* Then I copied the whole **master-gatsby** into this one and stripped it from all the pizza stuff.

#### Todo:
* improve the Layout
* copy it into **gatsby-ts-starter**
* strip the animations
* save it as the **gatsby-ts-starter** project
